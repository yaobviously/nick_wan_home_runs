Predicting Home Runs and xSwing From MLB Statcast Data

Nick Wan hosts Kaggle competitions for fun. These are my notebooks for two of them. 

The Home Run competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nwds-xhr  

The xSwing competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nwds-xswing  

My xSwing entry was one of the only two entries to exclude information from after the swing.
